# WezTerm Sidebar Scrollbar Work
## As-Implemented Scrollbar Notes

### 1. Fixed Sidebar Background Rendering ✅
- Updated `paint_sidebars()` to use dedicated z-indices
- Each sidebar now allocates its own RenderLayer via `gl_state.layer_for_zindex()`
- Background uses sub-layer 0 for proper ordering

### 2. Right Sidebar "Cut a Hole" Rendering ✅
- Background rendered at z-index 12 with hole cut out for activity log
- Activity log content rendered at z-index 10 (shows through hole)
- Main sidebar content at z-index 14
- Scrollbars at z-index 16
- Implementation in `paint_right_sidebar()` with debug borders

### 2. Created ScrollbarRenderer Component ✅
- New module: `wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/render/scrollbar_renderer.rs`
- Features implemented:
  - Vertical/horizontal orientation support
  - Direct rendering at any z-index
  - Mouse hit testing (thumb, above, below regions)
  - Drag scrolling with state tracking
  - Page up/down on track clicks
  - Hover state management
  - Configurable min thumb size
- Uses RectF and window::PixelUnit types for proper coordinate handling

### 3. Integrated Scrollbar Rendering ✅
- AI sidebar exposes scrollbar info via `get_scrollbars()` trait method
- Added `render_sidebar_scrollbars()` method to render at approporiate z-index
- Removed Element-based scrollbar from ScrollableContainer
- ScrollableContainer now only provides ScrollbarInfo for external rendering

### 4. Current Status ✅
- Basic implementation working but bugs exist:
  - The user can see the scrollbar and activity log
  - The activity log and scrollbar track are properly positioned 
  - The scrollbar thumb moves when the activity log content scrolls

## Known Issues and Remaining Tasks

### 1. Known Issues
- The scrollbar thumb moves too fast: when the user scrolls a small amount the thumb goes all the way to the bottom of the track and stays there. We need to properly calculate the length of the content and ensure the thumb position (and the height of the thumb) accurately reflect that as the activity log content changes and scrolls.
- Not all activity log content is being rendered. If we compare the mock content in ai_sidebar.rs to what is being shown, some is being cut off or not displayed for some reason
- There is odd coloration to the left and right of the activity log area. It looks like some margin exists there without any background. This probably needs to be filled in with background color

### 2. Testing & Polish
- [ ] Implement auto-hide behavior with fade in/out on hover and scroll (hide after no activity or after mousing away for 0.25 secs)

### 3. Update Documentation
- [ ] Update TASKS.md with implementation results
- [ ] Document the finished scrollbar architecture and usage after user confirms all bugs are fixed
